## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Follow the [Michael Nygard ADR format](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record):

```markdown
# ADR-[Number]: [Short Title of Decision]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [List key people involved]

## Context
[What forces are at play? Technical, organizational, political? What needs must be met?]

## Decision
[What's the change we're proposing/have agreed to?]

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- [What becomes easier or better?]

**Negative:**
- [What becomes harder or worse?]
- [What tradeoffs are we accepting?]

**Neutral:**
- [What changes but is neither better nor worse?]

## Alternatives Considered
**Option 1**: [Brief description]
- Pros: [Why this could work]
- Cons: [Why we didn't choose it]

## References
- [Links to related docs, RFCs, benchmarks]
```

**ADR best practices:**

- One decision per ADR — keep focused.
- Immutable once accepted — new context = new ADR.
- Include metrics and data that informed the decision.
- Reference: [ADR GitHub organisation](https://adr.github.io/).

```

**User guide best practices:**

- Task-oriented, not feature-oriented ("How to export data" not "Export feature").
- Include screenshots for UI-heavy steps (reference image paths).
- Test with actual users before publishing.
